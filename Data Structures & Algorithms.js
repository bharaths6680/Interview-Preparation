/* Datastructure in js 
1. Arrays in JS:
    we store the data to perform operations like: adding, removing and accessing the elements.
    operations in js: push, pop, shift, unshit, slice, splice.
2. Stacks in js:
    It revolves around LIFO (Last In First Out)
    we can do: push, pop and peek (read the first element of the array)
3. Queues in js:
    It revolves are FIFO (First In First out)
    using queues we can perform an array of methods like
    1. enqueue: adding the element at the end of an array
    2. dequeue: removing the element at front end of an array

Intermediate data structures:
Linked lists

Algorithm topics:
1. What is Algorithm
2. Measuring Performance
3. Time & Space Complexity
4. Big O notation
5. Math algorithms
6. Sort
7. Search
8. Mic Algorithms & problem solving

1. What is ALgorithm?
An algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a problem.
points:
1. should have well defined inputs & outputs
2. each step should be clear & unambigurous
3. language independent (should support all the programming languages)

why??
we can solve one problem with multiple approaches using algorithms

How to represent complexity?
1. Big O notation (O-notation)-> worst case complexity of an algorithm
2. Omega notation (omega-notation)-> Best case complexity of an algorithm
3. Theta notation (theta-notation)-> Average case complexity of an algorithm

1. Big O notation:
It represents expressing the complexity of an algorithm using algeobraic terms.
It has 2 characteristics:
1. It expressed in terms of input
2. It focuses in
ex: Inputs -> Algorithm -> output
add two numbers: 
Inputs: 2, 3
algorithm: add numbers & return the sum
output: retur results

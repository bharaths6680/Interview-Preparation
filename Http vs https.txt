http vs https:
http(hyper text transfer protocol) https(hyper text transfer protocol secure)
These are the protocols are used to transfer the data over the internet.
HTTP: not encrypted 
data is intercepted every one can read access the data, attackers can alter the data.
HTTPS: it is Encrypted using SSL(secure socket layers) or TLS(transport layer socket)
 This encryption ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read or 
 tampered with by unauthorized parties
 How: HTTPS provide authentication, it will make sure that the server we're communicating with 
 is actualy the server wanted to communicate with.
why HTTPS imp: 
data integrity: ensures the data cannot be tampered during the transmission 
security: encrypted data protecting user information and maintain the confidentiality.
authentication: protect against the phising attacks 
trust: users can easily trust 
seo: usually search engines prioritize more on https links, so it will increase the site's search ranking. 
In summary, while HTTP is suitable for general information that does not require security, 
HTTPS is essential for any website that handles sensitive information or where data integrity, 
authentication, and user trust are important
